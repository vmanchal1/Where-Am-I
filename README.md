# Where Am I
Welcome to the Where Am I. localization project! In this project, I utilized ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.

This project covers several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:

  * Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world

  * Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot

  * Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results
