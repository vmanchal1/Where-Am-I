# Move-It
Welcome to the Where Am I? localization project! In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.

Over the course of this lesson, you will learn several aspects of robotic software engineering with a focus on ROS:

  * Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world

  * Utilize the ROS AMCL package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot

  * Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results
